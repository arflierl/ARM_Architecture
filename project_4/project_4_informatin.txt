This project again uses the UART and memory mapped GPIO.  Additionally, interrupts are enabled for both a timer and the UART
and handlers for these interrupts are provided.

The program displays instructions to the user along with a moving asterik character.  The asterik initially moves to the right
and the direction of the movement can be controlled by the user.  The asterik will only change direction if a correct
inpur is received from the user, and incorrect commands do not result in any strange behaviour.  Additionally, the asterik
will stop moving when it has reached the beginnig or end of the output string.
